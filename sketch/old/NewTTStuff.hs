{-

Differences between Voice and Chord (except the obviously different composition styles):
  - Voice is a Monoid, Chord just a Semigroup (??)
    - Rationale: We want to separate Note/Chord/Rest
  - Scores are always sorted (i.e. more like (multi)sets than lists) (??)
  - TODO is there Monad/Applicative for MultiSet/SortedList?
