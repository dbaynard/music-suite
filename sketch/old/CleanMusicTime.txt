## Misc Music.Time API

- Determine future approach to rest/chord as well as naming of Note/Delayed/Stretched
    - Solved, see RENAME and GeneralizeVoiceChordTypes
    - Compare applicative composition Const/Id/Pair etc

- Name of events/eventsV etc
- Name of singleStretched etc
- Hide/move unsafe vesions + assert that everything else works (conceptually) with meta

- Score simult/simultaneous
- Remove Position._setEra/_setEra
- More catenation/juxtaposition functions (compare Tidal et al)
- More chord functions
- Separate Behavior/Reactive/Segment better

- New names
