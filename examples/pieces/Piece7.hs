The idea of blocks (notes in the form-level score) which has directions (vector sums)
The vector represents some kind of process (tonal modulation, dynamics, whatever)


{-
Another thing:
  I was thinking earlier of using some kind of vectors to represent modulation (or generally, change).

  I.e. a problem with composing predetermined blocks is that it is context-insensitive.
  For example if you compose music a and b as (a |> b), you have to verify yourself that the transition
  from a to b actually makes musical sense.
  
  We could have a form of composition that compensated for this, i.e. (a |~> b) checks that a ends in the
  same key as b begins, and otherwise transposes b to achieve this. I recently wrote a form of voice composition
  that did something similar.
