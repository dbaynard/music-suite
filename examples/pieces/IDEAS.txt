"Choreographic" string section â€“ lots of divisi, relatively few notes
        Similar thing with woodwind/horns vs trumpets etc?
Piece based on "reactions" in different sections, using an FRP network or similar underneath

Floaters (in all sections at various points in the piece...)
  This is a more pure "drone/texture piece" than Interludes
  Important:  
    A "floater" is [Aligned Note]
    Consider a more general [Aligned Voice]
      This is essentially back to the canons of Passages/Interludes, but with the better understanding of larger voices,
      and the sonic possibilities of a large orchestra.
    Use more doublings, i.e.
      3(II=afl,III=picc),3(II=Ob d'Amore, III=CA)3(II=bcl,III=bcl),3(3=Cbsn)
      43(all doubling Flug,III=picc tpt)3(III=bastbn)1
      2perc [] timp str
    
  Ex:
    4 vln solo
    8 vln solo
    4 vc (on specific string?) solo
    4 vla solo
    4 vln solo trem.
    vln a4
    str a4, 8, 16, 32, 64 etc
    
    fl, afl, baskl
    afl, ob d'amore (or CA)
    
    

Formalized thematic transformations (start with something simple, a very small Category "the category of melodic transformations" etc)
"Tiles" idea (piano pieces?)
Orchestral piece based on string section glissandi (phased/alternating durations and registers and "resting points") througout
        Winds and percussion for sustained notes, colour and rhythmizations (microtonal to follow the free pitch of the strings?)

*Actual* soundscape for orchestra (with recorded sound, i.e. 4-8 speakers *around* the orchestra) using prerecorded sound together w. orch
Simple, not too syncronized approach (i.e. no clicks)

*Loops* for orchestra/large ensemble. 15 or so parts, everyone has an *individual* part played in some tempo (can be looped). For each performance,
conductor decides everyone's starting point and duration of the piece (include suggestions!). Do it so that wraparound (in all parts) is *long*, say over 24 hours.

Piece for string section placed around audience (too non-standard for now)

Hocket/stereo idea again. Esp string sections I and II playing hockets, augmented by specially placed perc etc.
