Vivier-inspired

Use 1,2 or 3 melodic lines (possibly DIFFERENT SECTIONS/VERSIONS OF A SINGLE INFINITE LINE)
  (Generate line using self-similar techniques of Hudak)
  Phrasing?
  "Text?", (conceptually)

For each line, somehow generate chords/blocks (similar to the modulation technique used by Vivier),
so each line becomes a homophonic block.

These lines are distributed through the orchestra.
  Determine orchestration or line-material first?
  Ways to orchestrate such blocks (homogenous/unhomogenous ensembles)
  Some lines may not be heard all the time (maybe generate like that and "edit" out stuff, eventuallly
  making it fit the orchestra)

POSSIBLY VERY GOOD IDEA
  Thin out to a single line
  Then make them move more independently, in pitch and time
  Eventually they become a new polyphonic structure
  
  Conversely, turn polyphony into homophony by gradually making pitch and time relations the same

  Relation to Weaving/Threads?
