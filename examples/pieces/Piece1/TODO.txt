DONE
  Write down suggestions for more textures (see below)
  Choose do's and dont's
  Harvest previous study sketches
  Work in large chunks (1 hour or so) before seriously reviewing results

  Refer to last printout comments
  Try to develop horn textures (adding more brass or winds as needed)
  Adapt strings, add winds, percussion and soloistic textures

  Check (briefly) general ranges, registers etc (the 4th and 6th-based voicings are underused, currenly it's mostly
  octave variations of the 2nd/3rd/5th-based voicings)
  Consider rewriting one of the climaxes (i.e. last winds) using the 4th-based voicing
  String drones backing that climax could also use 4th voicing!
  Registers in the middle and climactic sections are wierd (strings/winds too close, missing tenor etc)


  Prolong string tremolo over drones
  Add more WW and trumpet stuff earlier
    We are losing the fast figure on p38 etc. Add soft DT WWs here!
  Timpani track (from paper sketch)
  Glsp/vib/hrp track from paper sketch
    Retain first and 151 more or less as is
  Fix slow wind pattern at end
  3) Do something about the strings (no more 3-quaver patterns!) before climax
    Gradually add longer quaver patterns (and more notes/manually add leading notes?)
      In 2,3,5,7 etc
    ?
  4) Vary the drone durations in lower strings (see new abstraction above!)
  Considering reintroducing fast phasing in beginning


TODO (PRE EXPORT) (Sun)
  1) Work on agile winds (esp first introduction)
    OK Interleave with the scale DTed pattern?
    Interplay with percussion
    Do not use the same frequency etc all the time
  2) Horns
    
    XXX THe high chords in middle -> trumpets/clarinets
    Use chords/drones elsewhere!
    
    Slow down close to climax
    Use 3-based phasing somewhere

  Misc fine tuning of registers and patterns

  X m286 harp pattern
  X m471 harp gliss or similar to mask switch
  X pp 65-70 trombone 3 doubles bass line (obl)
  X pp 71onw: doubleBass doubles tuba line
  X pp 84-84 sustain strings (some), gradually remove (with "dim"): 1) trumpets 2) horns
  X Misspelled gb/gs in final subjects
  X Harp bisb notation!
  X Percussion and timp from paper sketch
    Perc: From 281 onwards double VI and II in 2 sus cym (i.e. follow phasing)
  X Add timpani echo rolls (see paper sketch)
  X Add mallets note in vibra part!
  X Add "bells up" on horn climax!
 

TODO (POST EXPORT, Mon?, Tues)

  Horn and woodwind patterns!



  Bass line in main subject wrong: should be [e f a g]
    This forms a good repeating pattern with the upper part!
      [f e c d e f a g] etc.
      Use this to vary the main subjects (every other or so)
        4.5
        6
        5
        5
      Use as basis for variations of perc. pattern!
  
  Replace 6-part voicings at K and similar passages:
    [v1.1 v1.2 v2.1 v2.2 vla vc1] vc2 doubling basses (alternating with vc1)

  Revise ending again!
    Possibly: move string final resolution earlier, fade out after 6-8 bars (as written),
    then BRING BACK once or twice before fading out altogether.
  
  m261 Brass chord pitches
  Fix string registers!
    Notes out of range in string chords leading up to climax

  Many db bass drones too high!
  Add more stuff for harp and other pluck/perc
    At end, slow phased crotale rising figures + harp slow chords (even cymbals?)
    More perc and harp and end
    Improve harp gliss etc at end


  pp 14-18 CAREFULLY double bassoon with DTd trombone/tuba
  pp 36-38 CAREFULLY add strindberg pattern and/or tremolo
  pp 70-71 trumpets and tromb1 plays a pseudo-theme entry in a different key (based on the long chord
    they subsequently play at p72)
  pp 62-64 trumpets trombone 1 doubles horns

  At end when winds enter, make strings and horns more similar!
  Double-check breathing/stamina issues in all winds (esp horns!)
  Strings balanace issues
  Articulation etc
  Dynamics phasing in strings, beginning (and elsewhere, i.e. brass chords at end)

  Generally make things more smooth and idiomatic
  Strings p19: In melody remove f, and prolong first c (eventually stopping on pedal d). Sim. for the bass line.

  Finalize reh marks.
  Mail players to check parts!
  Looking through the parts:
    Flute: Jack
    Oboe/CA: ?
    Clarinet: <the player>
    Bassoon: ?

  TODO TODO TODO harvest previous sketches even more!

  TODO TODO TODO more woodwind stuff!
  GOOD Woodwind: Long notes (occassionally!)
  GOOD Woodwind: In general, just phased melodic patterns (simple fast, longer (unfolding) fast, and slow)
  MAYBE Woodwind: repeated notes, possibly with phasing (a la Holst: Planets 2nd movement)
  MAYBE Woodwind: simple phased alteration of notes in a chord (quasi-micropolyphonic)

  TODO TODO Using horns more slowly (less phasing, more drones)
  
  MAYBE Brass 2- or 3-note trem (trumpet/flug, horns, a la Petrouchka opening etc)
  MAYBE Brass repeated notes (in 2,3 etc) simple and effective
  MAYBE Brass repeated notes with longer swells incorporated
  MAYBE Brass long note moving into repeated pattern with cresc
  MAYBE Brass accented two-note figure (a la Reminisceners)
  MAYBE Brass long stopped horn pedals (in 2 and 4!)
  GOOD Brass rhytmised horn pedals (off-beat rhythm, a la Thaikovsky: Pathetique 4th movement)
  MAYBE Brass long open horn pedals
    MAYBE Brass Faking 6 horns
      Bassoons (mid-high)
      Flutes
      Clarinets (not above _p, mid)
      Trombones, brass chorus (ppp)
      Trombone with bucket mute
      Flugels (obviously!)
      High reg tuba
  MAYBE Brass Repeated articulated notes in trombs  
  GOOD  Brass Horns cuivre (unis?), very bright line (trumpet-like sound)
  GOOD  Brass Horns with other sounds in the middle (playing drones rather than phasing)
  GOOD  Brass Stopped horns (single phrases or muted?)      
  MAYBE Brass Experiment with more varied horn textures in general!
    Which?

  MAYBE Timp rolls (soft)
  MAYBE Timp Low (i.e. resonant muffled timpani sounds!)
  MAYBE Timp stacc, high, dry (close to edge?)
  MAYBE Timp repeated two-note pattern with cresc/dim (fixed interval, i.e. fourths, tritone, fifth etc)
  MAYBE Timp roll
  MAYBE Timp single accented (dry/resonant)

  GOOD  Strings traditional accomp figures (arpeggio, alberti, partitioned arpegio a la Bach C Major prel)
    See also Wagner: Valkyrie/Tristan
  MAYBE Strings rising scales (possibly landing on higher note a la Tristan overture)
  MAYBE Strings accentuated chords (triple stops etc)
  OK    Strings phasing (a la opening drones), using (1/3)-based rhythms rather than (1/2)
  MAYBE Strings trem sul tasto (see Adams: Shaker Loops)
  MAYBE Strings trem sul pont (see Adams: Shaker Loops)
  MAYBE Strings harmonics
  MAYBE Strings half-harm trill (as in Cirque Glacier)
  MAYBE Strings muted?
  MAYBE String trills (simple!) - needs to be mixed with something to avoid banality
  GOOD  Strings 2- or 3-note repeating patterns with leading/chromatic (small) notes inserted
  GOOD  Strings repeating pattern over all strings (3 or 4 notes!) a la Strindberg (also in Ravel, Wagner etc)


  Trumpets?
  Trombones?
  Flute,Oboe,CA,Clarinet,Bassoon
  
  More elaborate woodwind patterns (longer variants of the "agile" structure)
    How?
      Add longer notes
      Start *varying* register
      Do something closer to classical dove-tailing
  
    
  What more for harp? Look at some repertory scores (Wagner, Strav, Debussy, Ravel)
  Occassionally replace horn texture by:
    Harp chords 
    Harp+strings(?)
    Similar texture in clarinets (plus what?)
    Harp+celesta texture
    Low flutes+high oboe/cl (very soft!)
    Strings mixed with something?
    Trombones (careful! only accompanying something relatively loud!)
    Flugels?
  
------
  
Chamber (soloists vs single section etc) vs. partial tutti (two sections or more) vs. full tutti (all sections!)
  Beginning (string tutti) and first subject presentation at m66
  Reduce until wind presentation in m151
  Also quite soloistic around 200 (but never that much! The basic idea of the piece is sound mass)
  Tutti-style passages: leading up to m321 and onwards

Very important to leave breaks in all texture (for breathing/phrasing and also to make it transparent so that
the *other* textures can shine through!)

Woodwind registers!
  Note: In this piece we don't use a lot of doubling instruments. Hence
    Homogenous   close spaced chords -> easy
    Homogenous   wide  space  chords -> difficult
    Heterogenous wide  space  chords -> easy
    
  
  Flute: Airy low, rich mid, piercing hi (as in classical orchestration)
  Clarinet: Chalmeaux, weak middle, clarino (swith to BCl to use lower clarino?)
  Ob: Rough low, bright mid, soft high
  E-Hn: *Dark* low reg, singing high

Keep it simple for this piece!
  The harmonic traction and themes etc is sophisticated enough
  No need to make a "sound" piece
In constrast to much new music, this piece has expressive harmony! Use that!
Go back to "sound" and "continousness" later!
