In baroque music a 'Prelude' is a short improvisatory composition, usually consisting of a single chord sequence realised by a simple repetitive pattern. It is used to precede a more intricate work such as a fugue. An 'Interlude' is a transitionary piece used to link to surrounding music. This piece consists of series of interludes (TODO stations/places visisted etc).

The title is also a nod to Britten's Four Sea Interludes with which it shares much of the basic harmonic material, as well as Cage's Sonatas and Interludes with which it share the basic structure.
