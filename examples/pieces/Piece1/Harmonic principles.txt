Ways to create tension:
  "Strange" stackings:
    Small intervals at bottom ()
    Small interval groups separated by wide leaps (anti registral unity)
  Inversly, normal chord rules:
    Few (P8^*n) compounds (usually 1 or 2)
    
    Larger intervals at bottom (harmonic balance)
    Dissonances separated by octaves (why?)
    Even size of intervals - equivalently even distribution through register (registral unity)


TODO

  Think *even more* about register etc

  Think about the notes in the form score (I think in general overlapping form-level notes should not overlap in register)
    In a sense we divide up the horizontal-vertical (i.e. pitch-time) space and assign a hexachord to each field!
  Figure out whether the 4 sections should really be of equal length!
  
    
  Break away from the nested recursive scheme (but still use it somehow!)
