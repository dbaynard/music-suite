Concerto for string instrument
  Instead of traditional solo-tutti dialogue use divided strings
  I.e. statements from conc. soloists is played by orch solo1,solo2 etc
    I.e. alter soloistic playing with obscuring/micropolyphony etc, borderline perception
  
  For winds etc, similar techniques, think about concerto grosso etc

Alternatively, this could be an orchestral concerto with multidiv and featured section leaders


POSSIBLY Use patterns
  >>> renderPattern (0<->10) (spat [2*|1,2*|2,4*|1] :: Pattern Pitch)
  [(0 <-> 2,d)^.event,(2 <-> 4,e)^.event,(4 <-> 8,d)^.event,(8 <-> 10,d)^.event]^.score
