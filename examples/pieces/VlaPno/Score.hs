Piano playing chords (resonating/decaying)
  First one by one, then 2-3, eventually long sequences
  Harmony classic/modern/pop style (i.e. fifths, some triads, some dissonance)
Viola providing "responses"
  First quietly, harmonics etc
  Later evolving into sequences (up/down), giving directions to piano
  
How do piano chords evolve?
  Into texture, or even closer to melody?
  Possibly just texture: drills, single arpeggios (as in harp study, etc)
Do the instruments eventually swap roles (are we allowing melody in piano for this?)
  NO!
